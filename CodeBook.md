# Variables and Data

mean(): Mean value

std(): Standard deviation

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/Train_x.txt': Training set.

- 'train/Train_y.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/Test_x.txt': Test set.

- 'test/Test_y.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 



# Work I performed to clean the data set
1. Downloaded data and unzipped the data set

2. Read the datasets

3. set the column names

4. Merged the train and test sets

5. Extracted the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

6. created a second, independent tidy data set.
